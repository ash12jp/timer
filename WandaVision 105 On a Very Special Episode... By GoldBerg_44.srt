<font color="#138ce9">WOO:</font> Quick history on our subject.

199
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,160
Born in Sokovia in 1989
to Irina and Oleg Maximoff,

200
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,870
both killed during an air raid

201
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,840
when Maximoff
and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

202
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,380
<font color="#138ce9">HAYWARD:</font> The twins were subsequently
radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,800
It's an oversimplification
of events, but, yes.

204
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,350
After unspecified experimentation
with the Mind Stone,

205
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,390
Maximoff gained
telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

206
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,600
<i>Back up, Jimmy.
Does Maximoff have an alias?</i>

207
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,610
- No, sir.
- No funny nickname?

208
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,940
Not a one.

209
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,070
And earliest tracking had her using
her powers against the Avengers.

210
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,150
Is that correct?

211
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,410
Right before she earned their trust
and became one herself.
